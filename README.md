# Todo_List

## Description
A to-do list is nothing but a list of tasks you need to complete in a certain period of time. 
Itâ€™s a very simple, efficient and extremely popular productivity tool,
the only problem is that you can find a lot of conflicting advice online on whether to-do lists work or not,
and whether you should keep them in your productivity tool belt at all.
